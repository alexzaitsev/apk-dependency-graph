'default.json' is a default filterset that is shipped with the releases.

It consists of the next filters:
package-name      - Java package to filter by, e.g. "com.mysite.myandroidapp". Empty by default.
filter-inner      - If false it will contain inner class processing (the ones creating ClassName$InnerClass files). True by default.
ignored-classes   - The list of regexps that will be applied to class names. 
                    If class name matches any of provided regexps - it will be ignored. 
                    By default it filters Dagger and ButterKnife classes.

You may extend this file or create a set of your own filter files for each project.
